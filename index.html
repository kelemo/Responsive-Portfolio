      <p>Welcome to my official portfolio page. I am happy that you are here. Here is a bit of information about me. My name is Kadiro Elemo. I am a student at the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp. I will become a full stack web developer, which requires proficiency in the frontend and backend development. So far, I am developing a high proficiency in the HTML and CSS, which means I can develop the skeleton of a website and style it.  This week, I am diving into the world of the Javascript that is all about making websites responsive. That sounds awesome!! Learn, code and work. I work as medical and court interpreter in Minnesota. As I love dealing with matters involving languages, I enjoy computer programming languages.That said what I am up to currently, let me give you something about my past.</p>

      <p> I have a rich tapestry of academic and professional background. From social works to anthropology, from law to international relations, from television production to language services, from teaching to taxi driving, I wear many hats. Last, not the least, I am the author of the book, "The US and Ethiopia: The Tragedy of Human Rights." I want to publish my works online in the near future. To know what I did in the past in a detailed fashion, please visit my website: kadiroelemo.com. Thank you for visiting, please come back again. Don't forget to follow me on Twitter and like my Facebook fan page. </p>
